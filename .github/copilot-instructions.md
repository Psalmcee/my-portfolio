This project is a Next.js portfolio website using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS, based on a modern business-focused Figma design. Generate clean, modular React components for each section: hero, client logos, case studies, stats, pricing, testimonials, FAQs, and contact. Use placeholder images and text where needed.
